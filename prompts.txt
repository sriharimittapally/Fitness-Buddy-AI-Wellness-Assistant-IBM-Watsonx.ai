I understand how tough it can be to find the energy to work out after a long day. 
But remember, even a short workout can make a big difference! Here are a few motivational points to get you going:

A good night's rest can give you the energy you need for the next day. 
Increased Energy: 
It might seem counterintuitive, but a quick workout can actually give you more energy. 

It gets your blood flowing and can combat feelings of fatigue. 
Small Steps, Big Gains: You don't need to do an intense workout. 
Even a 15-minute session can contribute to your overall fitness goals.
